# Blockchain and Trusted Decentralized Identity: Zero-Knowledge Proof of Identity for Attribute-Based Self-Sovereign Identity Management

This repository contains code of a prototype implementation of a decentralized privacy-preserving identity management system with zero knowledge proofs of identity based on blockchain technology.
A protocol for **secure document exchange**, Zero-Knowledge **SNARK Proofs** and Zero-Knowledge **Bulletproofs** are combined to form a complete system.
The implementation is based on the following open source projects:
* Protokoll for managing digital documents [SPROOF](https://github.com/sproof)
* Toolbox for creating and verifying SNARK Proofs on Ethereum [ZoKrates](https://github.com/Zokrates/ZoKrates)
* Library for creating and verifying Bulletproofs [ING-Bank ZKRP](https://github.com/ing-bank/zkrp)

**Thanks to the developers for creating these awesome components and making them available to the community!**

A short usage guide is following soon.
